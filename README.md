# Triage-System
A triage system is a method used to prioritize and organize patient care in emergency situations.
The goal of triage is to ensure that the most critically ill or injured patients receive medical attention first, while less serious cases are attended to later.
The priority level determines the order in which patients are seen by medical personnel.
Triage can be performed by nurses, paramedics, or other trained medical personnel.
